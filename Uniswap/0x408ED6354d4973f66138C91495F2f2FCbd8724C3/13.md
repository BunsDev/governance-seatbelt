> # Should Uniswap governance contribute funding to the Nomic Foundation?
> 
> ## **Summary**
> - Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.
> - The Nomic Foundationâ€™s work will be focused on Ethereumâ€™s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereumâ€™s public goods support structures.
> - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.
> - The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereumâ€™s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.
> - Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.
> - **Weâ€™re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**
> 
> ## **Funding**
> The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why weâ€™re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.
> The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and weâ€™re aiming to raise $15M more.
> 
> ## **Why Uniswap?**
> Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and weâ€™ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols. Currently, [Uniswap is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhatâ€™s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. Weâ€™ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:
> 
> 1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).
> 2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.
> 3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.
> 4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.
> 5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.
> 
> We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and weâ€™d love to have the Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort .
