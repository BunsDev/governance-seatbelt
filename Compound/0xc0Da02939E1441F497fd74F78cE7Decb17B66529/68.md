  <summary>Proposal text</summary>

> # End cCOMP Borrow Rewards
> This proposal stops COMP rewards for cCOMP borrowing using the new Comptroller function allowing for splitting COMP speeds. COMP rewards will remain the same for cCOMP suppliers.
> 
> Currently, there are COMP rewards given to cCOMP borrowers while the borrow cap is in use. This creates a situation where the net rate for borrowing COMP is negative.  As such, COMP borrowing is forced to the borrow CAP, and the market is unable to reach equilibrium. This proposal will cause the net rate of borrowing COMP to be positive and will result in the market reaching equilibrium.
