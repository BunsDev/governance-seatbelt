  <summary>Proposal text</summary>

> # Add LINK Support
> LINK is a widely distributed token, with significant liquidity both on and off-chain. As a new market, it will be introduced with the following conservative market parameters: 
>  - Collateral Factor: 0%
>  - Reserve Factor: 25%
>  - COMP Speed: 0.0014625 (also set for UNI, BAT, ZRX)
>  - Interest Rate Model (JumpRateModelV2)
>  - 2% APY borrow base rate
>  - 20% APY borrow rate at kink
>  - Kink at 80% utilization
>  - 100% APY borrow rate at 100% utilization
> 
> A 0% collateral factor provides a “no risk” approach to adding the new asset, and allows the protocol to test if the interest rate model and other parameters are a proper fit. Once the market develops there can be an immediate follow-up proposal to increase the collateral factor based on market performance, stress tests etc.
> 
> The Reserve Factor, COMP Speed, and Interest Rate Models were chosen based off the parameters for similar assets (UNI, ZRX, and BAT)
> 
> #### Oracle
> The current oracle and TUSD proposal's new oracle is compatible with LINK there is no change needed.
> 
> #### cLINK Contract
> The cLINK contract is based on the most recently deployed cToken (cWBTC2) implementation, which includes a sweepToken enhancement for governance to collect accidentally sent tokens received by the proxy contract.
> 
> #### Special Thanks
> 
> Special thanks goes out to MasterofNonce for writing the CAP description; Arr00 for helping write simulations; mistertom, jmo, blck, and rleshner for helping decide the parameter proposals; and the community in general for the support and TRiLeZ to organize and deploy the necessery contract and the whole proposal.
