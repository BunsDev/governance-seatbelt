> # Address Whitelist for Submitting Proposals 
> Right now, to make a proposal, a contributor must have (or have delegated to them) 65k COMP. This threshold is a good spam deflection mechanism, but creates a burdensome hurdle for some contributors.
> 
> In additional to keeping the 65k COMP threshold, we propose including a whitelist of contributor addresses, managed by the community multisig, who will always have the right to submit proposals, regardless of the # of COMP delegated to them, relieving a pain point in the current contributor experience.
> 
> Arr00 wrote the updated code, wrote tests/simulations, and did a bug bounty program. The overall code change is relatively small.
