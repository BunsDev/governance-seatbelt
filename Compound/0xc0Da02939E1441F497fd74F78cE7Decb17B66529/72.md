> # Risk Parameter Updates for WBTC, UNI, and COMP
> ## Simple Summary
> 
> A proposal to adjust three (3) total parameters across three (3) Compound assets.
> 
> 
> ## Background
> This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) chosen by the Compound community. These parameter updates are the fourth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).

> [Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2021-11-30/2688)
> 
> 
> ## Motivation and Specification
> 
> This set of parameter updates seeks to level set assets to a Moderate risk level of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Note that some are different from the original [risk level consensus check](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) as market conditions have changed.

> ## Dashboard
> 
> 
> Gauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.
> 
> As shown on our dashboard, these changes will slightly increase Value at Risk, but the corresponding increase in borrow usage is substantial.
