> # [Temp. Check] Should Compound retroactively distribute COMP tokens to early users?
> This question has been [debated and specifics have been worked on](https://www.comp.xyz/t/should-compound-retroactively-airdrop-tokens-to-early-users/595v) for about the past year by the community.
> 
> This proposal serves as a temperature check, ensuring that this initiative has sufficient support before making further proposals as to address how to distribute the token to early users.
> 
> The actions of this proposal are nil - the protocol does not change at all regardless of whether this proposal passes or fails. Rather, this proposal gauges consensus regarding the issue in the following way:
> - FOR: You believe COMP tokens should be distributed to early users in at least some amount and/or way.
> - AGAINST: You believe no amount of COMP tokens should be distributed to early users.
> 
> If this proposal...
> - PASSES: The community will continue its efforts in distributing COMP tokens to early users. A series of follow-up proposals will guide the community in finalizing the total amount, the distribution model, and the way in which the tokens are distributed.
> - FAILS: The community will abandon its efforts of this initiative.
> 
> A quick summary in support and opposition of this initiative:
> - FOR: Early users were key in Compound's success. Their early use of the protocol shaped it to be what it is today, and those users should be given the power to continue shaping the protocol. Compound should continue to decentralize ownership of the protocol by distributing voting power amongst its early community members and users.
> - AGAINST: Compound should use the tokens in the treasury as incentives for new work to continue growing the protocol.
> 
> Note: Since governance proposals require actions, a nil action has been provided.
