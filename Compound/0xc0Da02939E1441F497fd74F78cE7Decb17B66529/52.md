> # Lower Proposal Threshold to 65,000 COMP
> Governance Bravo presents the ability to update governance parameters. Here, we alter the amount of COMP needed by a CAP or COMP address to push a governance proposal to a vote.
> 
> While this 65k threshold only enables 1 additional EOA to propose, it makes the CAP process considerably easier to navigate for community contributors. Over time, this threshold may be reduced further, but this is a conservative & meaningful step in the right direction.
> 
> This proposal stems from discussion started by arr00: https://www.comp.xyz/t/lower-proposal-threshold/1659
