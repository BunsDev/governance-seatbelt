> # Return Accidentally Sent Funds
> Previously we established a rule that every half year we send back funds that were accidentally sent to contracts managed by Compound governance ([proposal 37](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/37)).
> 
> There was one request that meets the requirements: the [transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbfb32d43e5a4d9a5ebc18709697cbedb1c149b282e104ce2d38ded68a8d635c0) sent 5,000 USDT to the [cDAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d3a536e4d6dbd6114cc1ead35777bab948e3643) contract, after the 10% penalty applied we are sending back 4,500 USDT
