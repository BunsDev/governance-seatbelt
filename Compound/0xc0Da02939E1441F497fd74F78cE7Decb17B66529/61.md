> # Dynamic Risk Parameters
> ### Background
> 
> For almost two years now Gauntlet has formally and informally worked for Compound to perform [market risk assessments](https://gauntlet.network/reports/compound), contribute to [treasury management](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/21), [optimize incentives](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/35), calibrate [risk parameters](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/39), and [upgrade](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/30) the [protocol](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/33). During that time Gauntlet has been able to refine our core models and agents specifically for autonomous interest rate protocol's like Compound.
> 
> As the protocol continues to decentralize to the community our position is that dynamic risk parameters are a vital component to growth.
> 
> [Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223)
> 
> ### Contributor Grant 
> 
> Gauntlet is requesting a streaming grant for continuous market risk management to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.
> 
> Supported Risk Parameters include Collateral Factor, Close Factor, Borrow Cap, Reserve Factor, and Liquidation Incentive. Gauntlet will also develop a [Risk Dashboard](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223#risk-dashboard-8) for the community. 
> 
> At the start of every quarter for one year Gauntlet will create a proposal to update the service fee payment (higher or lower) in accordance with the formula outlined in the full proposal.
