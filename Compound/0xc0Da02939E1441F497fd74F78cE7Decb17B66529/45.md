> # Add TUSD Support
> This proposal adds [TrueUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376) as a supported asset.  
>  
> TUSD is a 1:1 US dollar backed stablecoin. TUSD is the only stablecoin that has [real-time, 24/7 attestations](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/trusttoken) from Armanino, a top US accounting firm, providing assurance that the token is fully collateralized by US Dollars. 
>  
> ## Market Parameters 
> This proposal sets TUSD with a collateral factor of 0%, reserve factor of 7.5%, and unlimited borrow cap. These parameters follow the values set by USDT, with 0% collateral factor. The collateral factor can be proposed to be higher with a future proposal. 
>  
>  This proposal updates the Compound price feed to peg TUSD to $1, similarly to USDC. By using a peg, weakness in the underlying asset will not change collateral requirements for users borrowing TUSD.
>  
> [The interest rate model](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb564da37b41b2f6b6edcc3e56fbf523bd9f2012) for TrueUSD relies on the same model as cUSDT and cDAI, JumpRateModelV2. 
>  
> ## Contracts 
> cTUSD is an upgradeable cToken contract that has been modified to accommodate potential transfer fees in the underlying token. 
>  
> The cToken contract has been reviewed by OpenZeppelin and the Compound team. The cTUSD contract has been reviewed by the TrustToken and Ethworks teams. 
>  
> The case for why TUSD benefits compound has been discussed by the [compound community here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/trueusd-listing-proposal-stay-tuned/1490)
