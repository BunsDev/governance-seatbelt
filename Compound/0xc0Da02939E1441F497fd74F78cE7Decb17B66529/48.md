  <summary>Proposal text</summary>

> # Update and Standardize cToken Implementation
> This proposal is a patch, developed by Compound Labs, which updates the base cToken implementation contract and adopts it across all upgradable markets.
> 
> ### Changelog
> The `seize` function has been modified to transfer 2.8% of a liquidation to cToken reserves, reducing the risk of cascading liquidations that could render the protocol insolvent. With each liquidation, the protocol's ability to recover (or utilize reserves) increases.
> 
> Given the proliferation of COMP-like governance tokens, the `delegate` function has been merged into the base cToken implementation.
> 
> ### Adoption
> The seven upgradable cTokens, deployed starting 18 months ago, currently rely on five different cToken implementation contracts, many of which lack the most modern features.
> 
> This proposal unifies all upgradable cTokens with a single implementation, which reduces the surface area of technical debt, and slightly reduces gas costs.
> 
> ### Development
> This patch was developed publicly, coupled with completed scenario analysis. In addition to the Compound Labs bug bounty program, a secondary bug bounty was offered through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/compound/).
