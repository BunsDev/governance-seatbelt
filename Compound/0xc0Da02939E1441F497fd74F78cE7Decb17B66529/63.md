> # Temporarily Disable COMP Rewards
> ## Objective
> 
> Disable the distribution of COMP rewards, temporarily 
> 
> ## Justification
> 
> [Proposal 62](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/62) introduced a bug in the COMP distribution logic that allowed users borrowing certain assets to claim more than their intended share of COMP. This puts all of the COMP tokens in the Comptroller contract at risk, but not those in the Reservoir contract. For more details, [see Leshner's tweets here](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443380518498848768). This change will prevent further COMP from being distributed until the correct logic is restored. 
> 
> ## Details 
> 
> This change disables distributing accrued COMP until a long-term fix is tested and implemented. As this change was pushed out as quickly as possible, please follow along in the forum thread where we will provide more information during the review period
