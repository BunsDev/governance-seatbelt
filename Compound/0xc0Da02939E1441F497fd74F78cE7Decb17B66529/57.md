> # Set Pause Guardian to Community Multi-Sig
> The [Pause Guardian](https://compound.finance/docs/governance#pause-guardian) is emergency functionality used to pause supply, borrowing, or liquidation in a market.
> 
> This proposal transfers guardianship from Compound Labs (which has always held this role) to Community Multi-Sig created by members of the community: [0xbbf3f1421D886E9b2c5D716B5192aC998af2012c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbf3f1421D886E9b2c5D716B5192aC998af2012c#code).
> 
> The Multi-Sig requires 4-of-6 signers to approve any transaction. The signer addresses can be seen [here on Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xbbf3f1421D886E9b2c5D716B5192aC998af2012c/address-book), and currently include @TennisBowling, @arr00, @blck, Compound Labs, Dharma Labs (@0age), and @jared. For full context and history on the Multi-Sig, please see [this post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-multisig-4-of-6-deployment/134) on the Compound Community Forum.
> 
> Setting the Pause Guardian address to the Community Multi-Sig will further decentralize and ensure the security of the Compound Protocol.
