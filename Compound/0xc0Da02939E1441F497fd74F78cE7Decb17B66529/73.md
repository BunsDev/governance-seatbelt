> # Add Market: USDP
> Pax Dollar (USDP) is one of the most regulated stablecoin around being regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”). This has the following benefits ([taken from here](https://www.paxos.com/a-regulated-stablecoin-means-having-a-regulator/)):
> - The value of each stablecoin token is tied directly to the value of the US dollar, and the amount of “reserve” dollars equal or exceed the number of stablecoins outstanding.
> - Regulators are overseeing the establishment and maintenance of reserves backing the stablecoins.
> - Reserves may only be held in the safest forms, such as FDIC-insured bank accounts and in short-term maturity US Treasury instruments.
> - Reserves are fully segregated from corporate assets, specifically for the benefit of token holders, and are held bankruptcy remote pursuant to the New York Banking Law.
> 
> This proposal serves to add a market for Pax Dollar (USDP) with the following parameters:
> - Interest rate model: same as cDAI, cUSDT, and cTUSD (stablecoin standard)
> - Collateral factor: 0% (standard to start)
> - Reserve factor: 25% (standard)
> - Borrow limit: none
> - COMP rewards: none (for now, pending a broader discussion)
> 
> This proposal also updates the Uniswap-anchored ChainLink oracle with support for USDP (pegged to 1 USD).
