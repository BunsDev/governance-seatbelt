  <summary>Proposal text</summary>

> # Close Deprecated Markets, Gas Savings
> This proposal is a patch, developed by Compound Labs, which updates the Comptroller implementation contract.
> 
> ### Changelog
> 
> The `claimComp` function has been optimized to significantly reduce the gas cost of claiming COMP across multiple markets at once, by combining all rewards into a single transfer.
> 
> Markets with a 0% Collateral Factor, 100% Reserve Factor, and Borrowing Paused are inferred to be *deprecated* by the Comptroller, and allowed to be completely liquidated. This allows the closure of all outstanding borrows and the removal of reserves in deprecated markets including SAI, REP, and future migrations.
> 
> ### Development
> 
> This patch was developed publicly, coupled with completed scenario analysis. In addition to the Compound Labs bug bounty program, a secondary bug bounty was offered through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/compound/).
